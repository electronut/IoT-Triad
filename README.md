#The IoT Triad

Internet Of Things (IoT) implementations usually consist of three
parts - the device itself, software that interacts with the device
(which usually runs on a mobile platform), and a cloud part that can
serve as an intermediary, which may host web apps for controlling the
device or dashboards for device data. In this three-part article/project, I
demonstrate an "IoT triad" by developing a simple Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) device, a cross platform mobile application, and data
visualization on the cloud.
